# oops_rectangle_c++
A basic implementation of opps using rectangle geometry algorithms in c++

Design and Implement a C++ program that implements the following:
  • 2D axis-aligned Rectangle class with floating point coordinates
  o Include methods for constructing an axis-aligned Rectangle with initial size and
    coordinates
  • Algorithm that checks whether or not a Point2D (see below) is contained in an axis-aligned
    Rectangle
  • Algorithm that checks whether or not two axis-aligned Rectangles intersect
  • Test code that creates instances of your class and tests your implementation

Given:
You can use this struct in your implementation. Feel free to modify this struct as well.
    struct Point2D
    {
    float x;
    float y;
    };
